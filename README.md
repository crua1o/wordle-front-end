# wordle-front-end
My first front-end project after only learning HTML/CSS/JS from freecodecamp. My initial vision of this was very amateurish and unorganized. I had no clue how html elements were formatted, and honestly I still don't. I was blown away by how much css went into a very simple design. Nearly every element needed to be attended to. The CSS still needs some work too. I definitely have a better understanding of how JavaScript is incorporated into a webpage to make it functional. It's sort of similar to Java GUI stuff, which I also have very limited experience on. The major functions in the JS aren't used to return values or calculate something, but rather to change attributes of the HTML elements. JavaScript has some syntactical differences from Java which I'm still learning as well. Overall though, I'm happy with the "final" product, even though there are still some features I can add. But for now, I will take a break and leave this readme as a "to-do" list for the future.

## to do
1. settings modal
2. clear word from text box after submitting (figure out clearBoard() function)
3. show correct word on board before getting the notification
4. if a word has a double letter, then only the first letter is shaded (unconfirmed rule?)
5. game should end after 6th guess. the guess is checked after the click of a button so unsure how to change this.
6. ADD LETTER BANK (used/unused letters)
